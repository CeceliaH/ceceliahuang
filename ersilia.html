				<p>Title: Ersilia</p> 
				<p>Medium: Paper, Thread</p>
				<p>Description: For the final project in my Introduction to Environmental Design class (ED1), we had to take a city from the book Invisible Cities and visualize it within a book. The city I had was Ersilia, a city where citizens marked relationships with strings and abandoned the city every time the strings got too numerous. I conveyed the migratory lifestyle of its inhabitants with the colorful paper expanding out from the city. To emphasize the strings, I made the landscape of the city black and white, but added patterns to the landscape and buildings to make them more interesting to look at. I think the network of the city is extremely important, so I used actual string to convey the connections within the city as well as thicker paper to express how these relationships continue even as the city is abandoned.</p>
