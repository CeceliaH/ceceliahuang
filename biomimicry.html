				<p>Title: The Biomimicry Building</p> 
				<p>Medium: Digital</p>
				<p>Description: My partner and I created a sustainable building based on biomimicry. Focusing on four areas (site, energy, water, and materials), we incorporated solutions based on biomimicry to make a greener building.  This building was designed to replace an old university building that was not earthquake-safe. It features leaf-shaped solar panels, lots of windows for optimal daylighting, and shades that provide passive cooling and heating by using material that responds automatically to temperature change.</p>
